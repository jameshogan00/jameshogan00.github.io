        <h2>About</h2>
    </div>
       <p class="opening-about">Knockbridge is a small village within the townland of Ballinlough (Baile an Locha) in County Louth, Ireland. The village takes its name from "Cnoic Bhríde" - Bridget's Hill - reputed to be a site connected with local saint Bridget. Nearby is Cuchulainn's Stone, which still stands, and where the legendary hero is reputed to have died.</p>
       <p>The village is centred on a crossroads with its most famous being Stephenstown House, a large ruined Victorian house, once owned by a branch of the Fortescue family. The house stands beside the River Fane, about a mile outside the village. </p>
       <p>Stephenstown Pond, about a hundred metres from the house, was redeveloped in the mid-1990s and is a public amenity. Stephenstown Pond has a conference centre and an 8,000 sq ft (740 m2) community enterprise space. It is a habitat for a large number of animals.</p>

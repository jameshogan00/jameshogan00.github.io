      <h2>Here's the problem</h2>
      <p>Mother nature is angry. We witness how she vents her frustration every time we turn on the
      news: Tsumanis, floods, typhoons, forest fires in northern parts of Russia - it's clear that
      no one is safe from harm, and we only have ourselves to blame. The latest UN report on the implications of
      unmitigated climate change vindicates how real the threat of global warming really is.</p>

      <blockquote id="human-quote">
        <p>"It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of observed warming since 1950, with the level of confidence having increased since the fourth report."</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since the 1850's.
       The issue is often percieved to be a far off matter to be dealt with in decades to come. The recent financial crisis has taken
       priority over tackling what cosmologist Stephen Hawking describes as "one of the greatest threats posed to the future of human-kind and the world."</p>

    play a role in preventing global warming. Do you live close to your workplace? Why not cycle instead of taking
    the car. Are your parents retired and looking for something to do? Suggest they try growing their own fruit
    and vegetables. Do you have children with a passion for reading? Why not buy them a kids book on environmental
    awareness <a href="http://www.ghgonline.org/yourplanet.htm" target="_blank">like this one</a>. There is so
    much you can do to help and you'll be surprised at the enjoyment you get out of it. Please make a difference
